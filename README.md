# consulting-notes-latex

LaTeX for hand written consulting notes inspired by Heinrich Rusche's [How to Take Notes for Work - Note-taking Tutorial for Professionals - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYFD09vQd3E).

There are two pages, a start page and a continuation page.

The start has all the areas Heinrich uses in his video:

- date
- client & topic
- participants
- seating diagram
- general notes (I provide a dotted graph)
- optimization ideas (I provide space for 5; you shouldn't need more)
- todos for me (I provide 5)
- todos for client (again, 5)


The continuation page has:

- more space for general ideas
- todos for me (7)
- todos for client (7)

With Heinrich's system I experience much less friction about where to put things when taking notes and about how to resurface information later.  My handwriting is atrocious and I decided I need a printed form with visual prompts and aids to rein in my scrawl.


## TODO

-[x] Add logo watermark behind dot graph.
